## LeetCode-Clone
Title: LeetCode Clone Project

Description:
This project aims to create a clone of the popular coding platform LeetCode, providing a platform for users to practice coding problems, improve their problem-solving skills, and prepare for technical interviews. The project contains a variety of features similar to LeetCode, including a user-friendly interface for browsing and solving problems, code submission and execution, discussion forums, user profiles, and progress tracking.

Framework Used: 
The project utilizes a combination of front-end and back-end frameworks to achieve its functionality. For the front-end, frameworks like React.js or Angular.js may be employed to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces. On the back-end, frameworks like Node.js or Django could be used to handle server-side logic, database management, and API endpoints.

Languages:
The project is likely to be developed using a combination of languages suited for front-end and back-end development. For the front-end, languages such as JavaScript (with React.js or Angular.js) would be commonly used for building dynamic user interfaces. On the back-end, languages like JavaScript (with Node.js), Python (with Django or Flask), or Java (with Spring Boot) may be chosen for implementing server-side logic, database interactions, and API development. Additionally, HTML and CSS would be utilized for structuring web pages and styling the user interface.
